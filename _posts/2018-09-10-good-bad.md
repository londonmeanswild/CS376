### This is an example of something with good design on Williams College. 
This application is used to add value to our student points, known as EPH Points. I chose this design because it's a huge improvement over the previous system (which used PeopleSoft), and I find it to be relatively error-proof. 

1) Users have the option of TouchID or a PIN log-in option. 
2) As soon as you log in there are two options: add funds, or see your balance. 
3) Add Funds has two options: bill me, or credit card charge. This is straightforward and simple. 
4) I like that you have to click "My Accounts" in order to see your balance, that way the amount is somewhat private. 
5) There is a simple side help panel, and a warning when you try to log out.

### This is an example of something with bad design on Williams College


This photo was taken while standing in the doorway of Whitmans dining hall, inside Paresky. As you can see, there are chairs on one side of the hallway, and a dining area on the other. This hall is used for people to go in and out of Whitmans. People trying to enter the dining hall line up on the left, in order to swipe their ID card. People who are leaving do so on the right, and then either cross through the line of waiting people to enter the seating, take a seat on the row of tall chairs to the left, or leave the area entirely. I believe this design is bad because traffic is always congested, crowded, and inefficient. It’s difficult to get through this hallway without hitting someone, or being hit by someone’s backpack. If people are seated on the left there is even less space to walk. It’s not easy to use, it doesn’t make people feel good, and it gets extremely loud. If you have any accessibility issues it’s nearly impossible to navigate this as well, since people rarely are paying attention to where they are going. People also tend to gather here, and stand and talk. Lee’s snack bar is at the end of the hall to the right of the exit door, and the Lee’s line has been known to intersect with the dining hall line. At peak meal times, people are lined up all the way to the exit door. Since this hallway ends at a door, traffic coming in and out of Whitmans, Paresky, Lee’s, and ‘82 tends to intersect here. People also like to congregate and catch up, since this is a central location on campus. Baxter hall, which is on the other side of the left stools, has a layout that makes navigating it difficult, and seating isn’t maximized. However, people still eat and hang out here. There isn’t much seating in Lee’s, while the Whitmans seating area gets extremely loud and crowded. The Dining Staff are great, the food is amazing compared to other schools, but accessing Whitmans is a horrible experience.
