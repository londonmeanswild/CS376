title: Design manifesto

TLDR; designers need to be constantly mindful of five things:
ethics (testing and implications of their technology)
* accessibility and equability 
* user-based design
* when tech won’t fix the problem (or makes it worse)
* the personas are probably only partially accurate

If you’re still reading, I’ve got a story for you. It’s about how I’m apparently incapable of following directions. 

### The first piece of advice I got going into college was “don’t major in sociology.” 
I have since majored in sociology, and am awfully close to a double in philosophy. The ‘hard skills’ section of my resume lists three computer science courses, three economics classes, introductory statistics, and a whole lot of skilled trades abilities. I'm really hoping that Steve Jobs was [right](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2018/06/12/why-liberal-arts-and-the-humanities-are-as-important-as-engineering/?utm_term=.53e0ff2597bd) when he said 
> it's technology married with liberal arts, married with the humanities, that yields us the result that makes our heart sing...

But what a mentor once described as useless has proven to be incredibly important. I’ve never thought of myself as designer before. Pre-college, I was a machinist and welder. So craftsman, sure. But a designer? That seemed like a job for people with artistic ability. Turns out, design isn’t just about making pretty infographics or app interfaces. It’s about creating functional and intuitive products that actually improve users lives. It’s about understanding the end user, as well as the potential consequences of implementing a design.  And this is where my humanities degree is useful. 
Part of sociology is ethnography, "the scientific description of the customs of individual peoples and cultures."<sup>1</sup> In other words, become part of a community in order to analyze them, then probably write up a book or article. If that makes you feel icky, then great, we're in the same boat. But when ethnographic principles meet design, a whole world of possibilities open up.

My Human Computer Interaction course (one of those three aforementioned CS classes) involved a group project with [Chris](https://cla1.github.io/) and [Kenneth](https://kennethan12.github.io/).  By combining our three individual proposals we came up with [heART](https://londonmeanswild.github.io/museum-experience/), a mobile application designed to * “make data useful”* for curators. We began with wanting to make database information [more three-dimensional](https://londonmeanswild.github.io/museum-experience/2018/09/28/initial-proj-proposal/). > Museum databases are flat and one-dimensional. There is no way to quantify the things people feel while looking at, or experiencing, art. This flatness makes it difficult to connect people with artwork based on hard-to-articulate themes (such as feelings)... We have decided to try and use the responses people have to artwork in order to add depth to museum data files. We want to show the “texture and personality” of a collection, and the way exhibits make people feel.

What we realized, however, when [starting the research inquiry process](https://londonmeanswild.github.io/museum-experience/groundwork/research/2018/10/04/CI-writeups/), is that we didn't understand our users at all. Curators weren't concerned with emotional responses, since emotions are subjective. What the curators were interested in, however, was communication. 

> ...one of her [U1] goals was to find pieces that invoke intriguing ideas and unexpected discussion points.

> most of the feedback he [U2] receives is positive, which made him worry that people who are confused or frustrated aren’t expressing this information to him. He even said he wished he could get visitor questions directly sent to his phone so he could answer them (given he had the time), that way it might eliminate some frustration... He said would like to know which galleries people liked the most, that way he could incorporate that feedback in his choices.

By the end of our design process, we ended up [creating an application](https://youtu.be/wmY6SomfXZg) that would visualize visitor feedback and connect curators with visitors who want to ask questions. 

We developed this project alongside UX design/research readings as a way to make the concepts tangible. What I didn’t expect, however, is just how useful my humanities classes would prove to be in navigating, and complicating, the questions we were about to face. 

### Design presupposes ethical considerations.
By that, I don't mean [calculating utility](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/utilitarianism-history/#IdeUti) or determining the proper [categorical imperatives to determine duty](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-moral/). I mean... when my group and I sat down to design and application for museum curators, we had an obligation to provide curators with the best product possible, to be transparent about their role in [testing](https://londonmeanswild.github.io/museum-experience/2018/11/08/usability-review/), and to be honest about our project goals. When we performed [contextual inquiries with students and curators](https://londonmeanswild.github.io/museum-experience/2018/10/05/contextual-inquiry-review/), we needed to be upfront about our motivations and understand the value of their time, as well as the responsibility we had to understand their needs and wants rather than looking for ways to cement our pre-existing opinions.  

More importantly, however, we had - and have - a responsibility to people who visit museums, not just curators. For example, each piece in the WCMA database is assigned a category by a curator. There are no ways to search with cross-category variables. Photographs by African artists can be in “Africa” or “photographs,” or even categorized by the photographer’s nationality. Each of these queries will produce a different result.<sup>2</sup> Since the artwork in WCMA's database reflects categorization bias, how could we intervene? How would our data representations help curators create more equitable, responsible, and accesssible exhibits?

How did the design process impact the decisions you made? 
What were the most valuable pieces? 
Were there limitations to the design process that you encountered?
How did this differ across different modalities? For example, maybe user testing with your prototypes was more illuminating in one modality than another. 
When did expectations not meet reality?
Were there some methods that were more challenging than others? What did you learn from this process?

Approach to accessibility
User-centered design — should have had more curator tests

Limitations:

The design process put parameters around the decisions my team and I made. Once we realized what we were testing for, or the questions to ask, it was time to iterate again. At every step we were pushing forward a half-polished product, guided by feedback that may or may not have been the best to follow. Our contextual inquires were guided by the best questions we knew to ask -- and those evolved with each encounter. Because our time and knowledge was limited, we often found ourselves looking back and saying "man, we should have asked **this one thing** differently, it could have changed everything." 

I consider this ability to look back and identify opportunities for change to be the most valuable takeaway.
