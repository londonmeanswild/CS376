title: Design manifesto

TLDR; designers need to be constantly mindful of five things:
ethics (testing and implications of their technology)
* accessibility and equability 
* user-based design
* when tech won’t fix the problem (or makes it worse)
* the personas are probably only partially accurate

If you’re still reading, I’ve got a story for you. It’s about how I’m apparently incapable of following directions. 
The first piece of advice I got going into college, was “don’t major in sociology.” I have since majored in sociology, and am awfully close to a double in philosophy. The ‘hard skills’ section of my resume lists three computer science courses, three economics classes, introductory statistics, and a whole lot of skilled trades abilities. I'm really hoping that Steve Jobs was [right](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2018/06/12/why-liberal-arts-and-the-humanities-are-as-important-as-engineering/?utm_term=.53e0ff2597bd) when he said 
> it's technology married with liberal arts, married with the humanities, that yields us the result that makes our heart sing...

But what a mentor once described as useless has proven to be incredibly important. I’ve never thought of myself as designer before. Before college, I was a machinist and welder. So craftsman, sure. But a designer? That seemed like a job for people with artistic ability. Turns out, design isn’t just about making pretty infographics or app interfaces. It’s about creating functional and intuitive products that actually improve users lives. It’s about understanding the end user, as well as the potential consequences of implementing a design.  And this is where my humanities degree is useful. 
Part of sociology is ethnography -- "the scientific description of the customs of individual peoples and cultures."<sup>1</sup> In other words, become part of a community in order to analyze them, then probably write up a book or article. If that makes you feel icky, then great, we're in the same boat. But when ethnographic principles meet design, a whole world of possibilities open up.
My Human Computer Interaction course (one of those three aforementioned CS classes) involved a group project with [Chris](https://cla1.github.io/) and [Kenneth](https://kennethan12.github.io/).  By combining our three individual proposals we came up with [heART](https://londonmeanswild.github.io/museum-experience/), a mobile application designed to * “make data useful”* for curators. We developed this project alongside UX design/research readings as a way to make the concepts tangible. What I didn’t expect, however, is just how useful my humanities studies would be in understanding the issues we were going to face.

social phenomena, ethics, technology-mediated experiences, accessibility, and user- 


How did the design process impact the decisions you made? 
What were the most valuable pieces? 
Were there limitations to the design process that you encountered?
How did this differ across different modalities? For example, maybe user testing with your prototypes was more illuminating in one modality than another. 
When did expectations not meet reality?
Were there some methods that were more challenging than others? What did you learn from this process?

Ethics
Approach to accessibility
User-centered design — should have had more curator tests

Limitations:

The design process put parameters around the decisions my team and I made. Once we realized what we were testing for, or the questions to ask, it was time to iterate again. At every step we were pushing forward a half-polished product, guided by feedback that may or may not have been the best to follow. Our contextual inquires were guided by the best questions we knew to ask -- and those evolved with each encounter. Because our time and knowledge was limited, we often found ourselves looking back and saying "man, we should have asked **this one thing** differently, it could have changed everything." 

I consider this ability to look back and identify opportunities for change to be the most valuable takeaway.
