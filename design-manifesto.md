How did the design process impact the decisions you made? 
What were the most valuable pieces? 
Were there limitations to the design process that you encountered?
How did this differ across different modalities? For example, maybe user testing with your prototypes was more illuminating in one modality than another. 
When did expectations not meet reality?
Were there some methods that were more challenging than others? What did you learn from this process?

User-centered design — should have had more curator tests

<!- 
The first piece of advice I got, going into college, was “don’t major in sociology.” Well, I’ve definitely
screwed that up. And to top off the “hard skills” section of my resume, I’ve been taking a whole ton of
philosophy too. But the other thing I’ve been doing is taking computer science. 

Part of sociology is ethnography -- "the scientific description of the customs of individual peoples and cultures."<sup>1</sup> In other words, become part of a community in order to analyze them, then write up a book or article. If that makes you feel icky, then great, we're in the same boat. But when ethnographic principles meet design, a whole world of possibilities open up.

Limitations:

The design process put parameters around the decisions my team and I made. Once we realized what we were testing for, or the questions to ask, it was time to iterate again. At every step we were pushing forward a half-polished product, guided by feedback that may or may not have been the best to follow. Our contextual inquires were guided by the best questions we knew to ask -- and those evolved with each encounter. Because our time and knowledge was limited, we often found ourselves looking back and saying "man, we should have asked **this one thing** differently, it could have changed everything." 

I consider this ability to look back and identify opportunities for change to be the most valuable takeaway.
